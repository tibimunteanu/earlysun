<!-- # Product — presskit.html -->

<!--
  **This is your product or game page**. It should focus on _ONLY_ one product. This is not a replacement for your product's website, but a quick way for the press to know it faster.

  [Check the actual rendered page for the code you'll find below.](http://pixelnest.io/presskit.html/example/product/)

  If you don't have a `data.xml` yet, the easiest way to start is to run this command in your presskit folder:

  ```bash
  presskit new -t product
  ```

  Then, open the generated `data.xml` file and fill the blanks while following this guide.

  <hr>

  For your company' `data.xml`, [refer to the company documentation](../company/).

  <hr>
-->

<!-- Don't forget to set your XML header correctly. -->
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

<!--
  Use a `<product>` or `<game>` tag.

  <!-- ## Relations -->

  <!--
    You can specify relations between products using the `<relations>` tag.


    Then, on this page product, you will see a new line in the factsheet:

    ```
    DLC:
    My Super Game: Ultimate Edition
    ```

    Of course, the `Product Name` value is clickable.

    In the related product page, a new value will also be added:

    ```
    DLC of:
    My Super Game
    ```

    _Obviously, since the name we provide in the example is not a real product (ie., the product data.xml does not exist), this tag will be ignored for this page._

    You can have as many relations as you want. You can use it to show DLCs, expansions, sequels, prequels, etc.

    **Warning**: you need to rebuild the presskit to see the changes.

  <!-- ## About -->

  <!--
    An "About Your Company" section is automatically generated from the content of the company page.

    This <abouts> tag is completely **optional**. If you don't want this section, just delete it. But sometimes, you want to add a description for a partner.

    This is this the place to do it.

    For example, if you have a publisher, you can speak a bit more about it here.

    Most of the time, you should link that to the <partner> tag above, if you want to explain a partner a bit more. But you could use this section for other purpose.

    The <link> tag is optional.
